# Tokenized Infrastructure Maintenance Funding

A blockchain-based platform for transparent public infrastructure management, condition monitoring, and efficient maintenance funding allocation.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless ecosystem for infrastructure maintenance with the following key components:

- **Asset Registration**: Comprehensive records of public infrastructure components
- **Condition Assessment**: Objective tracking of deterioration and maintenance requirements
- **Fund Allocation**: Transparent prioritization of repairs based on need and usage
- **Contractor Management**: Streamlined selection and payment processing for maintenance work

## Smart Contracts

### Asset Registration Contract
- Maintains detailed records of infrastructure assets (bridges, roads, water systems, etc.)
- Stores technical specifications, construction dates, and maintenance history
- Creates unique digital identifiers for each infrastructure component
- Enables public visibility into infrastructure inventory and status

### Condition Assessment Contract
- Tracks infrastructure condition using standardized assessment methodologies
- Incorporates sensor data and inspection reports with tamper-proof verification
- Calculates deterioration rates and predicts maintenance timing requirements
- Provides transparent condition scoring visible to all stakeholders

### Fund Allocation Contract
- Tokenizes maintenance funding for transparent tracking and allocation
- Implements algorithmic prioritization based on condition scores and usage data
- Enables community input on repair priorities through token-based governance
- Creates auditable records of all funding decisions and disbursements

### Contractor Management Contract
- Manages qualification verification for maintenance contractors
- Facilitates transparent bidding processes for repair projects
- Tracks work completion with verification requirements
- Automates payment processing based on verified work completion

## Benefits

- **Funding Transparency**: Public visibility into infrastructure maintenance spending
- **Optimized Allocation**: Data-driven prioritization of limited maintenance resources
- **Reduced Corruption**: Immutable records of contracting decisions and payments
- **Community Involvement**: Stakeholder participation in maintenance prioritization
- **Predictive Planning**: Early identification of developing infrastructure issues

## Getting Started

Detailed setup and implementation instructions will be provided in subsequent documentation.
